    "description": "# Parametric shelf bracket\n\nThis is a parametric shelf bracket that can be used to hold shelves. You can screw it inside wardrobes and other furniture or between two walls and lay a shelf board on top of it.\n\nI've printed it in PETG but PLA might be OK too.\nI've used 2 perimeters and 50% cubic infill to give it enough strength. As the bracket are very tiny, I wouldn\u00b4t  have saved a lot of time or filament by using less infill.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis design is my original design. It uses the OpenSCAD Screw Holes library from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1731893.\n",
