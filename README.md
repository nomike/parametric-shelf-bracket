This is a parametric shelf bracket that can be used to hold shelves. You can screw it inside wardrobes and other furniture or between two walls and lay a shelf board on top of it. It is designed to hold the board by it's own wheight and doesn't require screwing the board onto it.

I've printed it in PETG but PLA might be OK too.
I've used 2 perimeters and 50% cubic infill to give it enough strength. As the brackets are very tiny, I wouldnÂ´t  have saved a lot of time or filament by using less infill.
